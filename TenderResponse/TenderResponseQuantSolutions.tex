		\subsection{Purpose of Document}
		
		This document provides a description of the proposed solution submitted by Bitwise Developers in response to the invitation 
		for bids on tender for the Facial recognition system for communities from Quant Solutions.
		
		\subsection{Introduction}
		
		A community watch has identified a need to monitor and identify individuals who live and operate in their comminity, in order to 
		distinguish between people who belong in the area, and those who might be up to no good. 
		
		A possible solution to the problem has been identified by Quant Solutions, who envision a computer system that can actively monitor
		and identify individuals who operate in the area by using IP camera surveillance, and a back-end database to process and store captured
		images. The processed data can then be queried by a member of the community watch or police, who is authorised to and tasked with interrogating
		suspicious individuals. This can be done either through a mobile device, or a web interface.
		
	\section{Executive Summary}
	
	Bitwise Developers are a unique collection of aspiring IT professionals, each with ambition and sound judgement. 
	We are all in our final year of study at the University of Pretoria.

		\subsection{Project Description}
		
			\subsubsection{Problem Statement}
			
			A number of real time video streams, each with possibly different resolutions or orientations, need to be monitored for
			faces of individuals who operate in and around a neighbourhood. These faces need to be analysed and given individual identities,
			such that a database can be established and maintained and later used to identify specific individuals.
			
			\subsubsection{Objectives of the project}
			
				\begin{itemize}
				
					\item Gather facial feature data to be used to identify individual people
					
					\item Classify each individual
					
					\item Use a client application to attempt to identify a person of interest against the database of individuals
			
				\end{itemize}
			
		\subsection{Proposed Solution}
		
		Bitwise Developers believe that we can solve the problem by using our knowledge and resources, and by applying our skills as software developers.
		We propose a possible solution as follows:
