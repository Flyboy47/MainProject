\section*{Experience}

	\subsection*{2012}
		In my first year after finishing matric with 8 distinctions I got accepted to study BSc Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. 
	\subsection*{2013}
		During my second year of study, I was elected to the Residence Management Committee at TuksVillage Residence and served on this committee for one year. I completed the JCP Community Module as part of my course, creating a series of YouTube videos titled "The Ginger Chef", for which my group and I got awarded the "Best New Project". I helped out an overworked friend who designs websites for companies by doing the above mentioned Joomla! site.
	\subsection*{2014 - present}
		I develop an interest in Philosophy, and change by degree to BSc Information and Knowledge systems, so that I can double mayor in both Computer Science and Philosophy without being set back a year or two academically. I also started a Philosophy blog at http://sentivita.blogspot.com/. I am very thankful for the opportunities I have had to get to where I am.

\section*{Other Information}

	\subsection*{My Career Plan}

	 I have a very large interest in Artificial Intelligence, Human Consciousness and the link between them. I would like to continue my studies in both Computer Science and Philosophy, doing research and lecturing at a University. I aim to find what it is that makes Human Consciousness different from animal or other Consciousness, and bridge this gap, if possible, with Artificial Consciousness. I would also like to be an author and indie game designer in my spare time.

	\subsection*{Interests}

	I am fascinated by the human ability to think with intuition. I love AI, Philosophy and Psychology. I am also a lover of literature and music, playing piano and the tin whistle and writing a novel in my free time. I love language, and intend to learn many, but it is a slow process. I like games, and wish to have the time and resources to develop some of the ideas I have. Education also concerns me, and I wish to one day see the education system reformed to produce better results. This includes a reform of the current school curriculum as well as access to free, good quality education for all citizens. I hope to one day do something remarkable in each of these very different fields, and live a life that at least made a dent in the huge history of mankind.
