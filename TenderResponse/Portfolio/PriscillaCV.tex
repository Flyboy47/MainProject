\section*{Other Information}

	\subsection*{My Career Plan}
	
	I have always had a growing passion for computers, software and aircrafts. It was based on these interests that led me into pursuing a career in the technology sector. It is my primary set plan to complete my current degree in 2014 and in the near future pursue a career in Aeronautical Software Architecture and Engineering to design software for aircraft companies. My ideal dream job is to become an Aeronautical Software architect.

	\subsection*{Interests}
	
	I have great interest in travelling the world, which has resulted in my continuous organized trips to Europe, Asia and North Africa. I would love to travel more and experience more cultures in various countries. Cooking is another interest of mine, where I attempt to cook any recipe I lay my hands on and I enjoy practising my cooking skills for family and friends. Lastly, I really enjoy reading books and informative articles, I believe that reading enhances good reading skills and I always want to learn more, so my way of acquiring  knowledge is by reading.
